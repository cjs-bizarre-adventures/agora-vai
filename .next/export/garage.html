Designed and built in 2023, this car features a new chassis, transmission, and telemetry systems. Improving on what we learned in the manufacturing of its older brother, GP21, GP23 is undoubtedly the best car we have ever built. It&#x27;s track record is almost perfect, with 3 wins and 1 DNF in 4 races, including victory in the most important race of them all: the 2023 International Final. These results led the team to its first Greenpower Formula 24+ Championship, in our 10th anniversary of competing in Greenpower. Track record: Dunsfold 2023: 1st / Aintree 2023: 1st / Castle Combe 2023: DNF / Goodwood International Final 2023: 1st It has raced 5 times and it weighs in at 62.5Kg</p><a href="/">Go Back</a><p>Follow Us On Social Media!</p></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json" crossorigin="">{"props":{"pageProps":{}},"page":"/garage","query":{},"buildId":"BmXV1HhylEZqdvWue_wMu","nextExport":true,"autoExport":true,"isFallback":false,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
