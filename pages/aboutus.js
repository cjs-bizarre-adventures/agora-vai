            <h2>How it Started</h2>
            <div id ="rectangle1">
            <img src="https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/files/2016/10/psem-vence-siemens-engineering-design-award_em_inglaterra-1140x641.jpg" alt ="GP14"></img>
            <span>In its current format, PSEM started in 2013 because Siemens wantes to have a team that represented Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico at Greenpower.</span>
            <span>With that goal in mind, students from multiple engineering fields came together to start building in SolidEdge what would later be the team's first prototype, the GP14.</span>
            </div>

            <h2>2014</h2>
            <div id ="rectangle2">
            <span>In 2014, the team built the GP14 prototype to compete in the international final in Goodwood. With a spaceframe chassis in aluminum and a bodywork made of carbon fiber and glass, the total weight of the vehicle didn't even reach 65kg.</span>
            <span>Even though we couldn't compete due to technical problems, we ended up realising that we had one of the most advanced cars in the competition due to the lighness of the chassis and the way the suspension of the car was built.</span>

            <h2>2015</h2>

            <span>After the race in 2014 and having now returned to Lisbon, the team immediately started working on the new car. After analising the errors and mistakes of the previous year, we realised there was a lot of room for improvement. With that in mind, we focused on fixing those issues.</span>
            <span>From there, the GP14.EVO was built, which we took to England to compete. We ended on the 14th place from a total of 40 participants and we won the Siemens Engineering and Design Award for the first time!</span>

            <h2>2016</h2>
            <div id ="rectangle4">
            <span>After the great results of 2015, we kept improving the GP14.EVO, transforming it into GP14.EVO2. Simultaneously, we started a project of a new prototype, the GP16, which would only be built in 2017.</span>
            <span>In the 2016 races we got 24th place, an inferior result relative to the one we had reached the previous year, partially due to technical problems during the race. Even then, we managed to win once again the Siemens Engineering and Design Award for the GP16 project that, with some changes, would lead to the creation of the GP17 prototype.</span>

            <h2>2017</h2>
            <div id ="rectangle5">
            <img src="https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/files/2018/10/psem_template_fotos-1140x641.jpg" alt ="GP14 with team"></img>
            <span>After the Rockingham final in october 2016, it was decided that PSEM would advance with the construction of a new vehicle, the GP17. Given that ambitious objective, the team developed a totally different car from what was made up until that point.</span>
            <span>On this year, the team participated in a set of Greenpower competitions, making its debut in the F24+. After two of the set's races, we managed to qualify to the International Finals in Rockingham, in which we got the best result up until that point: the 6th place.</span>
            </div>

            <h2>2018</h2>
            <div id ="rectangle1">
            <span>With a new year, the team decided to advance with the construction of the evolution of the GP17, getting past the difficulties found in 2017 and building innovations that would bring good results for the team.</span>
            <span>On this year, the team participated with the GP17.EVO, qualifying for the International Final in Rockingham, which resulted in 7th place, even with the problems that occurred in the final moments of the race.</span>

            <h2>2019</h2>
            <div id ="rectangle7">
            <img src="https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D4D22AQH0qmHl6tqElw/feedshare-shrink_800/0/1691613079263?e=1702512000&v=beta&t=eVEQAzKUG1EQh8yKe4sM20ruzu5uh8cXPwvtgaFhS1M" alt ="GP14 with team"></img>
            <span>With the start of a new season, the team focused on optimising the GP17.EVO and building the GP19, the new prototype for Greenpower competitions. So, the 2018/2019 season was defined by the multiple conception phases of the GP19.</span>
            <span>It was also on this year that PSEM obtained its best result so far: 2nd place in East Fortune, Scotland! The result obtained in the final was inferior to expectations, but it wasn't representative of the other races of the season, and didn't stop our ambition to consistently obtain the top places of the scoreboard.</span>
            </div>

            <h2>2020</h2>
            <div id ="rectangle8">
            <span>The main objective of the 2019/2020 season was to finish and optimise the GP19, while the GP21 projects was also ongoing. The recruitment proces was way superior to previous years, resulting in the formation of a team with 32 elements.</span>
            <span>Inevitably, this season was marked by the pandemic, which led to the cancellation, postponing or delay of multiple activities and competitions. However, due to the hardwork of a motivated team, we managed to finish the GP21 project and perform all the tests so the GP19 was ready to go to new accomplishments.</span>
